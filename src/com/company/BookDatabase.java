/**
 * A book database class will contain a method to return a book object. We haven't exactly learned how to create a
 * database or read/write to files yet. We're going to use the knowledge we already have to create a class. Our class
 * will simulate a database and return a populated book object. We'll simulate a database by simply using if or switch
 * statements to look up a book based on SKU. Later, we'll create a database using Oracle that also returns a book object.
 *
 * Our book database will contain several book titles and the SKU code to look one up.
 *
 * Your assignment
 * Create a class that contains a method that takes one parameter, the SKU, and returns a corresponding book object.
 * Use If Statements to populate the instance variables of the Book class and return the populated Book class.
 *
 * Your database should contain the following books:
 *
 *
 * <table>
 *
 * <thead>
 * <tr>
 *      <th>SKU</th>
 *      <th>Title</th>
 *      <th>Author</th>
