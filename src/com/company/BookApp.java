/**
 * BookApplication 4
 * -----------------
 * The BookDB class already contains private member variables and a default constructor. It also contains public getters
 * and setters for each private member variable.
 *
 * While it is possible to create public member variables and avoid the getters/setters please don't do this. A small
 * puppy will run away from home every time you do this.
 *
 * Next, you'll add an overloaded constructor and a method.
 *
 * An overloaded constructor is a constructor that takes one or more parameters. You can create multiple constructors as
 * long as the parameter types and counts are unique. Create a constructor  in the BookDB  class that takes an SKU and
 * populates the private member variables. The constructor by default will return the appropriate BookDB object when it
 * is called. You do not need to include a return statement.
 *
 * Next, create a method in your Book class called getDisplayText(). It takes no parameters. When called it returns a
 * string containing the author, title and description. Do not use System.out.print() in your class. Simply return the
 * string and let the calling class handle the print statements. You can use this method to print your book information
 * to the console or a file or a web page.
 *

/**
 * BookApplication 2

 * Create a method that returns the pricing for a requested number of books. Five books at $20.00 should return
 * $100, if they are in stock. If they are not in stock, that should be handled appropriately (hint - you decide).
